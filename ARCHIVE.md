1. 
    People learn things with an end goal in mind.

    Sites like Udemy have no organization to courses or logical pathway to the ultimate learning goal (Everyone who codes has one, and we can teach for those goals to maximize impact), they are just a massive collection of random courses. I see that their disadvantage. 
    
    Udemy Example: I could take an intro to scripting course (if I can even find a good one) but then what? **There's isn't a logical path to the next course to take based on what I'm interested in.** There is an incredibly simple solution to this. Allow a course to set other courses as pre-requisites. 
    
    With this system as more courses are added to ur site a natural hierarchy or "graph" of courses starts to form. We can now display "next courses to take", and "pre-requisite courses" when someone is trying to find their way to their final goal.

    - teachers know what the student has already learned based on selected pre-requisite courses
    - students don't waste time learning stuff they've already learned
    
    **Marketing:**

    I realized that trying to sell the "hierarchy" as a concept sounds cool, but it doesn't show how it solves a users **need**. Marketing is getting poeple to believe they need something so that they buy it. 
    
    Instead I propose we make "paths" (groups of courses with a final goal that users are asking for) tglained with a specific end goal... because that is what customers will buy! Like say a minecraft series of courses dubbed "Make Minecraft". 
    
    The "tagline" obviously will be based on the last course in the series (the final end goal: planetary terrain, multiplayer, minecraft clone, minecraft trees, procedural voxel destruction). The result is that poeple will have to buy the pre-requisite courses first because they want to get to the end-goal! 
    
    I'd say 90% of sales will happen if we can paint this perspective of "series" right (eg: a dedicated section in browse for "series". A "series" page that displays a series of courses. Maybe alos show a "tree structure" of connections?).

2. 
    Increase runway and do quality assurance by offering in-person classes (2 birds in one stone, steadier revenue + quality assurance)
    
    We could aim for high interest catalyst and exciting but simple to learn niche' subjects that the internet has (so far) failed to fill.

    catalyst example (clickbaitable, something that is exciting and not common)
        make a game engine => simulate billions of players at once in multiplayer (but also make a game engine)
        voxel terrain => destructible planet scale voxel terrain

        - blog posts and tutorials to attract customers
            - "How to build planet scale terrain" announcing planetary voxel terrain course
        - game development subjects
            - planet scale terrain [almost done. low investment high return if we can make it viral. Try to hook PippenFTP build the earth in minecraft youtuber]
            - [high investment low return?] make a game engine (simplified, very simple, non time consuming, and not frustrating)
        - web development subjects
            - make an e-commerece store/website with golang, stripe, heroku, and postgres
            - make a discord clone (with cloudflare workers, D1, R2, DurableObjects, Ember.js)

    Recruit teachers> We need to figure out compnesation (salary, company stocks compensation, profit share with courses?). Should we have "Official courses"? Alternative. Invest in recruiting other users to build courses on our site! Make the process of building courses user friendly and offer "making your first course" tutorial that guides users to make a course (simple, connect to github, make single README.md file section)
    
    Obviously we need courses to kickstart the process. Teachers will teach where there are students.

    Most of the below "series" reuse existing courses!

    On "series" page, have a "next course to buy" that the user can click "buy" on

    Help my code isn't working!!

    NEW IDEA: Q&A system where people earn points if they gave the answer that solved the person's problem. We give away "points" that the user can use to get courses for free.
    
    To solve this Udemy has a "Q&A" section for each course. **They've attacked the problem in the most direct way possible.** But what are people using even more than the Q&A system? Discord servers! With Discord you can make more than just a Q&A section, you can organize your community, make announcements, threads, showcase channels. Discord is a place for your student to come together as a community. Youtube is also probably the most exciting place when it comes to discovering cool things programmers have built. So what we are we going to do? Each course is going to be like it's own dedicated discord server. We aren't just selling courses, we are offering the whole social experience, online.

    **Marketing:**

    Marketing is selling a good to saisfy a need. People need a place to ask questions and get help. They also will create or find a community to satisfy conversing with poeple with similar interests.
    Each course should display what students are currently online and which ones aren't online (ege: like discord). This does something important. It shows you aren't alone in what your doing. This gives a sense of not being alone. And its encouraging to know other people are working on the same thing you are.

    People have a need for recognition. Ranking system and posts system? Upvotes? User's get a higher rank by getting upvotes?

    People are motivated by recognition and percieved reward.

    Upvotes can be gained through the following:
    - posts (showcase / tutorial / help)
    - answers (answering questions. The user that gives the answer that solves someones problem gets upvotes)
        - explore giving a free course for each new rank a user gains?
    - finishing a course!

    Posts system like medium. The purpose is for course progress to not just be a checkmark, but to be recognition. It's just so cool to see what people have accomplished. 
    
    I'm think of it like a bunch of mini master thesis'?
    
    I'm still stuck on how to keep continuity between the posts system and chat system and Q&A system. But they should each have a purpose.

    Video uploading? Best thing I can think of: In broswer recording tool? after you record it is stored in the cloud and you can share that?

    **Marketing:**

    I have no idea. But first we need to figure out why students would want to make a post vs use our chat system. Somehow I need to change it from "sparker needs ppl to make posts" to "students want/need to post because..." 

    **Marketing Ideas:**
    I say it's best used as a method of showcasing progress, and users who want to indirectly add tutorials or information they learned to a course. Its also a more permanent way of showcasing work/sharing thoughts than a fast-paced chat system where conversations get forgotten (don't delete this).

# ** OLD **
An old thing I wrote that I thought was inspiring idea of the future of the company. Realizing it's nopt very useful for the success of the comapny I removed it from the main README

## Lets take a visionary tour of what I'm invisioning
Imagine a courses site where each course is like a dedicated discord server. You have live chat, voice, and video. As well as posts that showcase your progress and skills and what you are capable of. 

Just like discord, you get live noifications to help you find where people have mentioned you. The best part is that you can view the chat and posts without interrupting your work on the course, because the chat *is* part of the course! There is even an overlay DM voice and video system so you can chat directly with your best friend while working on a course together!

The priorty customer is the END USER (the students). Not the teachers, or the companies using our site for hiring. We want to be like apple. Our students are king, even at the cost of possibly losing a profitable deal with another company. No ad's (well at the beginning we may use google ads to keep from going under). We make and sell really good courses. Thats our business model.

Eventually courses will have to start costing more (as an example: apple is expensive, but worth it). We can get students hooked by making all lower level courses free, and then allow teachers to charge more money the higher the level of the course is (the level of a course depends on the number of prerequisites the student has to go through to get to your course).

### Hierarchy system
The best part is the course hierarchy system. Every course is part of a massive "tree" of courses. Unlike other sites where you have to look through thousands of random courses, at sparker3d.com, courses can set pre-requisite courses! That way you know where to start, and what courses to take next!

Courses are also given a "Level" based on the depth of pre-requisite courses it has (Courses at Level 0 are always free!). You "level up" by taking courses that are at higher levels. It gives the community a ranking system, the highest level students are held in awe by their peers because of their "rank".

Without realizing it, you get sucked in (like a video game!) and end up building a really awesome portfolio from all the showcase posts you made! Now you start posting your profile on job hiring websites. No actually, sparker3d.com is a hiring website, based on skill, not certification.

### Job hiring (once we have 1 million users)
Since our site is kinda becoming the future of online tech portfolios, we add features targeted at helping companies and entreprenours hire our students. Our top priority is to benefit and protect the students at all costs. Again, the priorty customer is the END USER (the students). Not the teachers, or the companies using our site for hiring. We want to be like apple. Our students are king.
