An old thing I wrote that I thought was inspiring idea of the future of the company. Realizing it's nopt very useful for the success of the comapny I removed it from the main README

## Lets take a visionary tour of what I'm invisioning
Imagine a courses site where each course is like a dedicated discord server. You have live chat, voice, and video. As well as posts that showcase your progress and skills and what you are capable of. 

Just like discord, you get live noifications to help you find where people have mentioned you. The best part is that you can view the chat and posts without interrupting your work on the course, because the chat *is* part of the course! There is even an overlay DM voice and video system so you can chat directly with your best friend while working on a course together!

The priorty customer is the END USER (the students). Not the teachers, or the companies using our site for hiring. We want to be like apple. Our students are king, even at the cost of possibly losing a profitable deal with another company. No ad's (well at the beginning we may use google ads to keep from going under). We make and sell really good courses. Thats our business model.

Eventually courses will have to start costing more (as an example: apple is expensive, but worth it). We can get students hooked by making all lower level courses free, and then allow teachers to charge more money the higher the level of the course is (the level of a course depends on the number of prerequisites the student has to go through to get to your course).

### Hierarchy system
The best part is the course hierarchy system. Every course is part of a massive "tree" of courses. Unlike other sites where you have to look through thousands of random courses, at sparker3d.com, courses can set pre-requisite courses! That way you know where to start, and what courses to take next!

Courses are also given a "Level" based on the depth of pre-requisite courses it has (Courses at Level 0 are always free!). You "level up" by taking courses that are at higher levels. It gives the community a ranking system, the highest level students are held in awe by their peers because of their "rank".

Without realizing it, you get sucked in (like a video game!) and end up building a really awesome portfolio from all the showcase posts you made! Now you start posting your profile on job hiring websites. No actually, sparker3d.com is a hiring website, based on skill, not certification.

### Job hiring (once we have 1 million users)
Since our site is kinda becoming the future of online tech portfolios, we add features targeted at helping companies and entreprenours hire our students. Our top priority is to benefit and protect the students at all costs. Again, the priorty customer is the END USER (the students). Not the teachers, or the companies using our site for hiring. We want to be like apple. Our students are king.
