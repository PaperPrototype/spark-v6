			<h1 class="c-code text-center" href="/courses">The Story behind Sparker</h1>
			<p>
                I am a self taught software engineer. I taught myself through online courses. 
                But there was a problem. I realized to truely gain the knowledge to build
                something like make my own minecraft clone from scratch, make a game engine 
                from scratch, or my own website from scratch, it was a mangled mess of random tutorials and courses. And it sucked.
			</p>
            <p>
                I decided to fix online education, and build the software focused school of the future 
                that would replace college courses and the mangled mess of online learning. I didn't care how 
                long it would take or how hard it would be. It was inevitable someone would do it eventually. So why not me?
            </p>

			<p>
                Yay! I learned the basics of scripting? What course do I take next?... 3 hours later, you are still searching.
			</p>
			<p>
                I found there is rarely an answer to that question. To solve it 
                I came up with "pre-requisite" courses. The idea is that
                any course can set another course as its pre-requisite!
			</p>
            <p>
                Say someone uploads a "Intro to Scripting" course, then someone else uploads a "Intro to Unity" 
                course. The "Intro to Unity" course can set "Intro to Scripting" as a pre-requisite, so you know which course to take first.
            </p>
			<p>
               This "hierarchy" system allows natural curriculums and course pathways to evolve as more courses are uploaded! Solving the problem of "What course do I take next?".

			<h1 class="c-code text-center" href="/courses">Quality of learning Experience</h1>
			<p>
                If you've ever taken online college (or any online course) you may notice a problem in the "quality of the experience".
                It can be hard to contact the teacher and get help, and sometimes you have no idea what he is saying so you just blindly follow along.
			</p>
            <p>
                Some online courses solve the first problem by having a dedicated discord server, so the teacher 
                and other students and chat live and share their screen. Which is awesome!
                But I wanted all courses on sparker to have dedicated discord servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                And well, each course on sparker has its own builtin discord-style chat system! <a href="/paper/voxels-unity/view/44?channel_id=6">check it out!</a> 
                Code-highlighting is also supported through <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code">markdown</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I plan on having (simplified) live voice and video + screensharing (just like in discord) as soon as I can find/pay poeple to help me build it (or figure it out myself).
            </p>
			<p>
                The second problem of "not getting it" I found could be fixed by teaching courses to in-person 
                focus groups.
			</p>
            <p>
                I actually spent 6 months testing <a href="/paper/software-fundamentals/1">this course</a> on 5 friends of mine. 
                I ended up throwing the course away because it was fundamentally flawed. 
                And by fundamentally flawed I mean... I rewrote the course 3 times.
                I am forever indebted to them. And will continue to test courses out with in-person 
                focus groups to make sure our courses are the highest quality on the internet.

			<h1 class="c-code text-center" href="/courses">Build a Portfolio...</h1>
			<p>
                A degree doesn't really show employers what you are capable of. A portfolio of work you've done will. Thats why I decided sparker shouldn't offer certificates as a "proof of work". 
                Instead "proof" comes as showcase portfolio posts (exact number varies per course and is set by the course's author).

			<h1 class="c-code text-center" href="/courses">Free Courses</h1>
			<p>
				All beginner courses are free! I figured whats the point in paying for something if you 
                don't know if its any good? So yeah... I mean what are you waiting for?
