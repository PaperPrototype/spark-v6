TODO:
Stripe API key needs to be switched to the live key.
Remove the "this site is in test mode" message in course.html

In order of importance:
- Course reviews
- Notifications

DONE:
Free courses don't require a stripe connection. User's don't have to sign up for stripe to publish a course, instead they must have a stripe if they want to charge money for courses.
